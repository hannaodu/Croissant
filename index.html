    <h1>welcome to my page</h1>
    <p>
      my name is hanna odulaja.i would love to contest for the president of
      Nigeria one day and i know i will win.i would love to serve my
      people.Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you all for such warm welcome and your
      support. I am happy to be here with people who will make a fair and highly
      important decision for the whole country and with the other candidates!
      Okay! Let us begin! Today, Nigeria has felt the wind of change and came to
      the crossroad. In this insight, you have to choose whether to make a kind
      of U-turn or to go forward prosperous future. What does that mean for all
      of us? That means that the time of big changes has already come, the time
      for changing the existed political landscape of our country, the
      motherland for most of the attendants. Nowadays, there is a tendency to
      consider politics as a show business for unfair and ugly people. However,
      I am going to convince you that this trend is wrong. Primarily, I would
      like to underline that if I become the face of our country, there are few
      important things that I will do to ensure the population gets all of its
      needs fulfilled day after day and state after state. First and foremost, I
      plan to provide the new legislation that will encourage the development of
      our country in the future, not only to assure meeting of the needs today.
      In particular, it will be useful to establish new funding of the public
      schools in the USA. Therefore, the existing taxes should be re-channeled
      from the other areas to the American education system. Secondly, the
      economy of our country is the central theme of the presidential platform.
      This way, I promise to make significant changes toward economic
      prosperity. Economic development has always been in the minds of a
      majority of us; however, the previous government leaders neglected this
      issue. Correspondingly, I propose to promote different new businesses,
      open areas, and new residential areas to bring the country to life.
      Further, I will lower the taxes as the government should not tax countryâ€™s
      way of prosperity and creation of new jobs. As a representative of the
      country, I will control the finance of Nigeria so that the debt will be
      less with the coordinated economic action plan.Finally, if I am elected,
      you can be sure that my campaign position is stable. Moreover, I assure
      all of you that your concerns and issues will be adequately addressed on
      the national level. If the previously mentioned position is yours ambition
      to our country, you will make the right choice and elect the reliable, and
      fair leader of Nigeria .
